 Description: This simple application prompts the user for a word. It then translates the word into pig latin and displays
 it on the next page. The user then has an option to re-play the game.
 
- If a word starts with a vowel, we add "way" onto the end.
- If a word starts with a consonant, we move all of the consonants that appear before the first vowel to the end of
  the word, then add "ay" to the end of the word.
- We treat "y" as a consonant.
